The game is a bartending trivia game, the game will start when the user clicks on the "play" button
Once the user clicks on the play button, an image of a cocktail will appear along with a list of ingredients that the cocktails require in order to make it (it is used as a hint for the user).
There will also be a submit button at the bottom where the user will have to input the correct name of the cocktail.
If the user gets the answer right then the next button (located under the submit button) will light up and allow the user to continue to the next cocktail question.
If the user get the answer wrong then an alert will show up and notify the user that they got it wrong and will not let the user to move on until they get it right.
There is a score represented above the questions and it will reflect if the user got the question correct

Future Development:
Make reset button work
